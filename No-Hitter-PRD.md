# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for a Python-based web application called "No-Hitter Forecaster." The app will utilize a novel statistical algorithm to analyze historical Major League Baseball (MLB) no-hitter data, identify trends, and predict the daily percentage chance that at least one no-hitter will be thrown in MLB on the current day. The prediction will run automatically every morning during the MLB regular season (typically April to October) and be accessible via a simple web interface. The goal is to provide baseball fans, analysts, and enthusiasts with an engaging, data-driven tool that highlights the rarity and patterns of no-hitters.

### 1.2 Overview
A no-hitter in MLB is a rare event where a pitcher (or team in combined efforts) prevents the opposing team from recording any hits over at least nine innings. As of September 2024, there have been 326 officially recognized no-hitters in MLB history.
<argument name="citation_id">2</argument>
 The app will scrape or load historical data, apply a custom algorithm to detect trends (e.g., seasonal, date-specific, and temporal patterns), and compute a daily probability. The "novel" aspect lies in the algorithm's integration of historical frequency, recency effects, and seasonal adjustments using a Bayesian-inspired model to estimate probabilities more accurately than simple averages.

### 1.3 Target Audience
- Baseball fans interested in statistics and predictions.
- Sports analysts and media outlets.
- Developers or data enthusiasts who may fork or extend the open-source code (assuming the app is open-sourced).

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 In Scope
- Collection and storage of historical no-hitter data (dates, pitchers, teams, etc.).
- Development of a novel prediction algorithm based on trends in the data.
- Daily automated execution during MLB season to generate predictions.
- Web-based interface for viewing the daily prediction and historical insights.
- Basic visualizations (e.g., charts of trends).

### 2.2 Out of Scope
- Real-time game monitoring or updates (predictions are pre-game, morning-based).
- Integration with live MLB APIs for current game data (focus on historical trends).
- Mobile app development (web-only, responsive design encouraged).
- Advanced machine learning models requiring external services (keep to Python standard libraries where possible).
- User accounts or personalization.

## 3. Features

| Historical Viewer | Allow users to query predictions for past or future dates within the season for simulation purposes. |

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Data Collection
- **Sources**: Use web scraping (e.g., BeautifulSoup library) from sites like Retrosheet or Baseball-Reference to fetch a list of no-hitter dates.
<argument name="citation_id">4</argument>
 Store in a local CSV or JSON file with columns: Date (YYYY-MM-DD), Pitcher, Team, Opponent, Notes (e.g., perfect game, combined).
- **Update Mechanism**: Script to refresh data annually or on-demand, as no-hitters are rare (1-3 per season typically).
- **Validation**: Ensure data completeness (e.g., ~326 entries as of 2024) and handle any new no-hitters via manual or automated checks.

### 4.2 Novel Algorithm
The core innovation is a Bayesian-updated Poisson model that treats no-hitters as rare events, adjusting base rates with historical trends and recency.

- **Step 1: Base Rate Calculation**
  - Compute average daily probability: Historical no-hitters (~326) divided by total MLB game-days since 1876 (~150 years * 180 days/season ≈ 27,000 days), yielding ~1.2% chance per day for at least one no-hitter (accounting for multiple games/day and Poisson approximation: P(at least one) = 1 - e^(-λ), where λ ≈ no-hitters per day ≈ 0.012).

- **Step 2: Trend Adjustments**
  - **Seasonal/Monthly**: Multiply base by monthly factor (e.g., September has ~16% of no-hitters despite ~17% of season days, based on 53 in September vs. average 46 in May/June).
<argument name="citation_id">22</argument>

  - **Date-Specific**: Boost for high-frequency dates (e.g., 6 no-hitters on April 27, May 15, Sept. 20, Sept. 28 across history, implying ~5% raw chance on those dates over ~120 modern seasons).
<argument name="citation_id">21</argument>

  - **Decadal Trend**: Adjust for era (e.g., higher in 2010s with 36 no-hitters vs. 1920s with 7), using a weighting factor for recent decades.
  - **Recency Effect**: Use exponential waiting time model (mean wait ~80-100 days between no-hitters). If days since last > mean, increase probability by a Bayesian prior update (e.g., posterior = prior * likelihood from exponential distribution).

- **Step 3: Novel Integration**
  - Combine via Bayesian formula: P(today) = Base * (Monthly Factor + Date Factor + Decadal Weight) * Recency Adjustment.
  - Example: For a September day with historical matches, probability might range from 1-5%, explained transparently.
  - To arrive at the solution: Load dates into pandas DataFrame, group by month/date, compute frequencies, fit exponential dist with scipy.stats.expon, then apply Bayes' theorem with uniform prior for daily rate.

- **Output**: A single % value (0-100) with confidence interval (e.g., ±0.5% from Monte Carlo simulation of 1,000 iterations).

### 4.3 Prediction Execution
- Run daily at 6 AM ET during season (April 1 - October 31).
- Input: Current date, last no-hitter date (auto-detected from data).
- Output: JSON file with % chance, explanation, and trends.

### 4.4 Web Interface
- **Framework**: Use Streamlit or Flask for a lightweight Python web app.
- **Pages**:
  - Home: Displays current % chance, e.g., "Today (July 26, 2025): 1.8% chance of a no-hitter."
  - Trends: Charts (matplotlib/seaborn) showing no-hitters by month/decade.
  - History: Searchable table of past no-hitters.
- **Deployment**: Host on Heroku, Vercel, or local server; ensure responsive for desktop/mobile.

### 4.5 Scheduling
- Use Python's schedule library or system cron to trigger the prediction script daily.
- Check if in-season: If current month in [4,10], run; else, display off-season message.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance
- Prediction computation: < 5 seconds (simple stats on small dataset).
- Web load time: < 2 seconds.
- Scalability: Handle up to 1,000 daily users (low traffic expected).

### 5.2 Reliability
- Error handling for data fetch failures (fallback to cached data).
- Logging: Track runs and predictions in a log file.

### 5.3 Security
- No user data collected, so minimal risks.
- Use HTTPS for web hosting.
- Sanitize any inputs (e.g., date queries).

### 5.4 Maintainability
- Code in Python 3.x, with dependencies: pandas, numpy, scipy, beautifulsoup4, streamlit/flask, matplotlib.
- Modular structure: Separate modules for data, algorithm, web.
- Documentation: Inline comments and README for setup/running.

### 5.5 Usability
- Intuitive UI with explanations (e.g., "Why this %? Based on September's high frequency.").
- Accessibility: Alt text for charts, keyboard navigation.

## 6. Assumptions and Dependencies
- Assumptions: Historical data remains publicly available; MLB season dates are fixed; no-hitters continue at historical rates.
- Dependencies: Python environment; internet for initial data fetch; hosting platform for web.
- Risks: Data source changes (mitigate with multiple sources); Legal: Ensure scraping complies with site terms (use APIs if available, e.g., MLB Stats API).
